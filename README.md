# Python portfolio
These are my personal projects for learning and developing my Python skillset. 

## Stellaris weapon simulator
This was my first personal project with Python. Before this I had done small projects from courses like building a snake game or a coffee making machine.
My goal with this project was to implement all that I had learned until that point.

## European Social Survey (ESS11)
This will be my second portfolio project whereby I will demonstrate and practice my Python and data-analytical skills.
The data that I will be using is from the European Social Survey round 11 - 2023. Social inequalities in health, Gender in contemporary Europe.

My goal with this project is to replicate statistical methods and techniques I learned during my studies, with Python instead of SPSS. 

At the time of writing (14-3-2025) my ESS11 project is unfinished. However, after finishing my end-to-end weather project I plan to implement the same workflow on the ESS11.

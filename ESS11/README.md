# European Social Survey (ESS11)
This will be my second portfolio project whereby I will demonstrate and practice my Python and data-analytical skills.
The data that I will be using is from the European Social Survey round 11 - 2023. Social inequalities in health, Gender in contemporary Europe.

My goal with this project is to replicate statistical methods and techniques I learned during my studies, with Python instead of SPSS.
This will include the following:
1. Exploration 
2. Preparation and cleaning
2. Analysis
   3. Descriptives (mean; mode; et cetera)
   4. Reliability and validity testing (alfa; factor analysis)
   5. Regression analysis (moderation and mediation)
6. Visualisation
   7. Primarily using matplotlib and seaborn

I will start with answering the following research question:
1. What is the relationship between educational level and political voting in the Netherlands?
